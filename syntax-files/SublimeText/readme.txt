Here is a ".sublime-syntax" syntax file for Sublime Text 4.
Format: see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html

This file can also be used for other tools as well, such as 'bat':

The older "tmLanguage" syntax definition file, where this sublime-syntax version is based on, can still be found here:
